# Particle-System
====================

Increasing/decreasing number of particles dynamically by Key Up&Down.

Five simultaneous particle systems.

Easing curves to control particle:

  1)Top-Left: Linear curve for decreasing the size of particles.
  
  2)Top-Right: Linear curve for increasing the size of particles.
  
  3)Bottom-Left: Linear curve for decreasing the velocity amplitude.
  
  4)Bottom-Right: Quadratic easing in/out curve for changing the size and the velocity amplitude of particles.
  
  5)Center: Cubic easing in/out curve for changing the rotation of particles.
